<h2>About me</h2>
<p>I am Samuel M.H. and I was born with something that Dilbert called "The Knack". Just that in my case the curiosity extends to almost everything I can reach.</p>
<p>You can expect me to be some sort of <s>nerd</s> engineer with a Master's degree and to have a job in the I.T. industry, but I'm also a sportsman who enjoys travelling, arts, and meeting new people.</p>

<h2>Professional career</h2>
<p>Everything started with my internship while I was in the last year of my degree at the <abbr title="Universidad de Alcalá de Henares">U.A.H.</abbr>. A proof of concept was required and several technologies had to be mixed up to get a working prototype (Microsoft Information Cards + WS + PHP + C + Perl + Radius + PEAP + OMG!), a huge effort that resulted in my ending degree project and proved myself I can quickly adapt to whatever technology is needed.</p>

<p>In my first job I codesigned a QR-based authentication system based on asymmetric cryptography and developed the web part. I also was in charge of the company network since I cabled the office and set up the production servers. I also gained experience designing architectures building systems for the IoT.</p>

<p>Then I moved to other company where I evolved as a web developer working with Django and JQuery (also started this web). A year later I was asked to integrate an advertising system into the webpage of one of the most important Spanish newspaper. I had just discovered recommendation systems and data mining, I needed more of that magic.</p>

<p>So I came back to the U.A.H. as a researcher and spent 3 months modelling urban traffic with SUMO and designing a web solution to deal with big data. I felt my greed for knowledge was not satisfied, I needed to know what machine learning and big data were. It was time to go formal, therefore I searched and found a course that suited my needs.</p>

<p>For the next year I enrolled in the <abbr title="Universidad Autónoma de Madrid">U.A.M.</abbr> where got my Master's Degree in Mathematics and Computer Science, Research and Innovation, Information and Communications Technologies (i2-ICT). I chose the cognitive intelligence itinerary, mixing subjects like:
<ul>
    <li>Machine learning</li>
    <li>Information Retrieval</li>
    <li>Web Mining</li>
    <li>Applied Bayesian Methods</li>
    <li>Ubiquitous computation</li>
</ul>
My thesis focused on automatic means to generate taxonomies, with a huge section about the state of the art.
</p>

<p>After the university, I took a small break and completed some interesting online courses related to the newests trends (MongoDB and Spark) in the industry as well as others more theoretical.</p>

<p>And one day I landed in my current job, where I work with microservices, geocodification, ElasticSearch, AngularJS and other funny tools to help companies to optimize their efforts based on geographical data.</p>

<p>As a curious mind, I've never been scared of new challenges. This has led me to be a generalist, an extremely versatile guy. My speciality is to learn new things; the more different they are to what I know, the better. Some of my off-work skills range from building a 555-based sound distortion circuit, to change the bearings of a washing machine; from handling a rotary plow, to bulding a NPW5 kite. There are too many cool things to be done! </p>
